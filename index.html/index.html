You seem like an intelligent, dedicated resercher, and just the kind of person we'd like on our team.

<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p>
    Yes, you are right as part of my doctrate work, i did study exoctic tribal dances. To answer your questions, my favourite dance are as follows,with definitions;
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        Polyesian chicken dance
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chikens,to encourage there livestocks to be "fruitfull".
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Icelandic hrownizn shuffle
    </dt>
    <dd>
        icela Beforenders developed f ire as a means of getting warm, there used to practice this dance, which involved huldding close together in a circle on the floor, and suffing there body around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow studends used to say he tought this dance inspired morden styles such as twerking.

    Arctic robot dance
</p>
<article>
    A very intresting means of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "mhoctic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of northen Alaska and Canada, later on however it was disccovered that they where just moving like this because they where really cold.
